Loading and Initializing the Models

Loading a pre-trained model. Loads a trained model, either for CIFAR-10 or for ImageNet, to avoid repeating learning processes with too much time and resources.
Configuration Set. Initializes configurations either from a config file or command-line arguments so that proper functioning of the model is ensured.
Optional Training :It begins training in scratch mode or fine-tuned with a new dataset if there is no pre-trained model
Data Handling

Data Preprocessing and Augmentation : Conducted raw data preprocessing such as resizing or normalization and used data augmentation to improve the effectiveness of training.
Data Loader Usage : Used data loaders to load data in batches. It also enables custom user datasets.
Prediction and Inference

Input Acceptance: Accepted inputs for inference. The dataset could be images or text.
Running Predictions : Used inputs to feed data through a model to compute predictions as a class probability.
Outputting Results: Outputs results, possibly as JSON for API responses, so it could be easily integrated with other systems.
User Interface

Interface Type: Offers the CLI or preferably a web-based interface for ease of use.
Interactive Elements: Uploading files, adjusting settings, and viewing results such as showing an image along with its predicted labels.
